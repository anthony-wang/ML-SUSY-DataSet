# ML-SUSY-DataSet
Exploration of dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SUSY

Build Machine Learning Algorithms from scratch Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, RBF & Neural Network model on SUSY dataset

Tuning their meta-parameters to explore, find & argue which model is best suited

Did cross - validation and used standard error to find the best parameters for each model
